\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

What is this paper about? What is discussed? Why is it of any
consequence?

The advancement of science is build on a trust in discovery of new data,
and through the use of reproducibility, scientist can gain confidence in
their research concluded data. But in recent time, the community have
been getting reports on more peer-reviewed preclinical studies that are
none reproducible(McNutt, 2014).

In this paper we will look more in to reproducibility of scientific
data, why its important for using to gaining trust and if its good
enough to be consider useful for the future scientist to use. The paper
will first present literature around the meaning of word reproducibility
and replicate, and its use in the science world. We will then discuss if
reproducibility is necessary or if the scientific data can be
replicated. How the use of R and a quarto document can help with
reproducibility of research, any problems that can which may occur and
if we can solve them. In the need we will try to conclude these
questions and what our thoughts on the subject of reproducibility of
scientific data.

\section{Literature review}\label{literature-review}

\section{Theory on reproducibility}\label{theory-on-reproducibility}

Smart stuff from others about the topic.

The cover story of The Economist ``How Science goes wrong'' uses the
terms for reproducibility from (Barba, n.d.) which is
``\emph{Reproducibility refers to the instance in which the original
researcher's data and computer codes are used to regenerate the results,
and arriving at the same results using their own data and methods}''.
While from the same review paper the term of replicability can viewed as
an ``\emph{instances in which a resarcher collects new data to arrive at
the same scientific findings as a previous study,''} or \emph{''a
different team arriving at the same results using the original authors
artifacts''.} With this we have a understanding that the terms of
reproducibility and replicability can overlap one another but can be
used differently. Another term is generalizability, where the results of
a study can be applied on any other context or population which is
different from the original case study. These three terms would refers
to the science that is''robust and reliable'' which is the foundation of
all scientific development for the ability to build on prior work. Here
we will try to focus on the use of reproducibility of scientific data.

The reproducibility is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for
replicability. Peng (2011) Discusses that reproducibility for a
publication should be a minimal requirement. As said earlier that
reproducibility is a way for the scientist to gain confident and trust
in their research but what is a research reproducibility? Goodman et al.
(2016) gives us three explanations of what research reproducibiliy
means:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Methods reproducibility, which is how the provision of enough detail
  about study procedures and data can be used to repeat the same
  research in theory and in actuality.
\item
  Results reproducibility, also described as replicabilty, is refered to
  obtain the same results from previously research when conducting
  independent studys but the process is the same as the original
  research.
\item
  Robustness and generalizability are two terms that can be used instead
  of the term reproducibility, where robustness means the stability of a
  experimental conclusion when it is either a baseline assumptions or
  experimental procedures. Generalizability can be refereed to the
  persistence of an effect in settings different from and outside of
  experimental framework.
\end{itemize}

\section{Publication bias}\label{publication-bias}

When it comes to publication on reproducibility one can encounter
publication bias which may affect the ability to publish the findings.
The worst case if a scientific journals contains a big collection of the
type 1 error. So what is type 1 error? Its the definition of a
incorrectly concluding of the research. (kilde) Its the size of the
error which the researcher is willing to accept prior to the hypothesis
test. Type 1 error is when H0 is rejected even if its true. It can be
about concluding that there is an effect even when its not. This way we
may end up with similar studies with no effect but there can be a risk
that we would find the wrong conclusion in the literature. This will
hurt later research that tries to replicate the experiment. An exempel
on this is the ``File Drawer Problem'' from Rosenthal (1979), where
studies with an H0 that can not be rejectet is sent to the file drawer
and the ones where H0 is rejected is published. This will go on to
create false positive. If prestigious journals manage to publish an
research with a false positive it will make it so that others will have
little motivation to try to reproduce it. Another error that can occur
is that its costly to invest in a research program which in the end will
create more false positive and may lead to ineffective policy changes. A
field that is known to publish research with false positive would surly
risk losing its credibility and trust from other scientist (Simmons et
al., 2011). The Young et al. (2008) tells that its ``\emph{more alarming
is the general paucity in the literature of negative data. In some
fields, almost all published studies sow formally significant results so
that statistical significance no longer appears discriminating}''. The
publication bias will also have effect on meta-analysis, which is an
combined result of multiple scientific studies(Russo, 2007). So when one
result is influenced by publication bias, the others may feel its
effect.

So when it comes it economic and how to be able to reproduce the
research, one can look at an old journal the ``Econometrica'' where
Frisch (1933) states that ``\emph{Statistical and other numerical work
presented in Econometrica, the original raw data will, as a rule, be
published, unless their volume is excessive}''. This states that all the
data ones used in its research should be presented if possible. But as
time passes, bigger models was needed to present the data which ended up
in researchers only publicing the results and the reproducing or
replicating of the research ended up nearly impossible. Solutions had to
be created for archiving the data, one was the American Economic
Association data archive(\emph{American {Economic Association}}, n.d.).
McCullough et al. (2008) points that ``\emph{All the long-standing
archives at economics journals do not facilitate the re-production of
published results. The data-only archives at Journal of business and
Economic Statistics and Economic Journal fail in part because most
authors do not contribute data}''. With other words, the solution didn't
work as one hoped for. Another solution is the ``computable documents''
solution that uses codes integral in the article, so that the research
can be submitted with the data necessary to fully be able to reproduce
the research.

Use a least 20 citations, a least 5 of them must be new (not from the
provided .bib file).

Use both in-line and normal citations.

Example:

(\textbf{gentleman2005?}) argues that bla bla bla. On the other hand
it's claimed that bla bla (\textbf{barbalorenaa.2018?};
\textbf{bartlett2008?}).
